## Finished goals

- [x] use vue 2 + ts
- [x] styling
- [x] open source caroussel
- [x] able to change language in the header
- [x] data from json

## Styling reasons

I styled the app very minimal because I feel like it would look messy if I added many bells and whistles.

The colors that I used are very neutral colors: white and blue

In the caroussel I chose to add some pictures to make the page a little bit more lively.
I tried my best to make the images feel like its a panaromic picture u can select parts of.
